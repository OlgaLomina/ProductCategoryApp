# ExpansesTracker
The requirements for the test project are: Write a simple expenses tracker application - User must be able to create an account and log in - Implement at least two roles with different permission levels (ie: a regular user would only be able to CRUD on his owned records, a user manager would be able to CRUD users, an admin would be able to CRUD on all records and users, etc.) - When logged in, user can see, edit and delete his expenses he entered - When an expense record is entered, each one has: date, time, description, amount, comment - Filter expenses by dates from-to - User can print expenses per week with total amount and average day spending. - REST API. Make it possible to perform all user actions via the API, including authentication. - Optional: demonstrate that by creating functional tests that use the REST Layer directly. - Bonus: unit tests! - You will not be marked on graphic design, however, do try to keep it as tidy as possible. - Write a README/HOW-TO with requirements, installation instructions and a document explaining the architecture approaches that you have chosen.
